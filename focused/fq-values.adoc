The correct answer is C.

A sustainable software development pace is a key tenant of Agile and Scrum. Pushing a developer to 'spend as much time as is required to complete an item' is not a sustainable development practice. You shouldn't have to violate labor laws and work standards to complete a Sprint Backlog item.

If a Sprint Backlog item can't be completed during the current Sprint, it just goes back into the Product Backlog. Then, during the next Sprint Planning meeting the team can decide if it should be again part of the next Sprint or not. It certainly does not 'automatically' go into the next Sprint's Backlog.

If a Product Backlog item does not meet the Definition of Done, it cannot even be presented at the Sprint Review, let alone a decision of that review meeting decide whether the item is done or not.

If an item is not completed during a Sprint, "the team should return any uncompleted Product Backlog Items to the Product Backlog." -Mary Iqbal, Scrum.org Blog

[#explanation]

Being respectful and committed means arriving to work on time, being rested enough to perform at your best, and supporting others.Scrum is meant to be a sustainable development framework. Forcing people to work overtime or work unpaid hours is not consistent with the Scrum Values."Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values:Commitment

Respect
CourageThe Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other." -The Scrum Guide, page 4

[#answer]

The correct answer is E.

[#explanation]

Always working to the best of your abilities to achieve the Sprint Goal shows an ongoing commitment to your team, as does helping others when needed.

Extraversion and emotional stability are not actually Scrum Values.

The five Scrum values are:

Commitment: The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and delivering high-quality work. Commitment means that team members hold themselves accountable for their work and take responsibility for delivering what they promised.

Courage: Scrum requires courage to make difficult decisions, to admit mistakes, and to challenge the status quo. The team must be willing to take risks and face their fears to achieve their goals.

Focus: Scrum teams focus on the work that needs to be done to achieve their goals. They prioritize their work and minimize distractions to deliver the most value.

Openness: The Scrum Team practices openness, transparency, and honesty with each other and stakeholders. They share information, progress, and challenges openly and seek feedback to improve.

Respect: Scrum teams treat each other with respect, recognizing the unique contributions of each team member. They create a safe environment where everyone can share their ideas and opinions without fear of judgment.

These values are important because they provide a foundation for a collaborative and productive team environment. When Scrum teams embrace these values, they build trust, increase communication, and work more effectively together. By committing to their goals, being courageous, focusing on their work, practicing openness, and showing respect to each other, Scrum teams can deliver high-quality products and continuously improve.

The correct answer is C.

[#explanation]

The Scrum Developers will hold each other accountable throughout the Sprint, which includes monitoring their progress and tracking their progress throughout the Sprint.

The Scrum Master is responsible for coaching others on Scrum theory, while the Product Owner is the one who articulates the Product Goal.
