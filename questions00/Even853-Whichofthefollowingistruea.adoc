D

[#explanation]

The Product Owner does not participate in the the Daily Scrum, nor are they required to attend it. They only participate in the Daily Scrum at the behest of the Developers.

Not even the Scrum Master is required to attend the Daily Scrum.

The Daily Scrum is for the development team.

Unless the Scrum Master or Product Owner is actually doing development for some reason and acting as a developer working on a backlog item, then they should not participate in the Daily Scrum. The Daily Scrum is for the developers only.
