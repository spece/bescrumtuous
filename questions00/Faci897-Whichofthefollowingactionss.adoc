[#explanation]

The Scrum Master is a servant-leader and should never 'tell' the developers what to do. The Scrum Master coaches and facilitates and allows developers to discover solutions and solve problems themselves.

Furthermore, the Scrum Framework does not allow the length of a Sprint to be extended, and only the Product Owner can end a Sprint early.

The Scrum Master does coach teams about the Scrum Framework, so coaching a team to ensure the 15 minute Daily Scrum timebox is not exceeded is a good use of the Scrum Master's time.
