Self-organization can empower teams by providing them with greater flexibility and autonomy, which can lead to increased motivation, creativity, and ownership of projects. 

Additionally, team members can better recognize and utilize everyone's strengths, while also facilitating deeper collaboration, shared responsibility, and more effective problem-solving. Lastly, self-organization can result in faster decision-making as teams have the authority to act in their own best interests.
