It is up to the developers to decide how to run their Daily Scrum, which includes decisions about who starts it and how it proceeds.

"The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work. This creates focus and improves self-management."

Furthermore, there are no 'team leads' or 'junior developers' in the eyes of Scrum. 

According to the Scrum Guide: "Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarchies. It is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal."
