[#explanation]

The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring that the Scrum framework is followed by the team and that the team is continuously improving. Two key aspects of this responsibility are facilitating time-boxed meetings and coaching people on Scrum values.

The Scrum Master is also responsible for helping the organization they work for to plan for Scrum adoption and advise on how to implement Scrum successfully.

From the Scrum Guide:

The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including:

- Leading, training, and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption;
- Planning and advising Scrum implementations within the organization;
- Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact an empirical approach for complex work; and,
- Removing barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams.
