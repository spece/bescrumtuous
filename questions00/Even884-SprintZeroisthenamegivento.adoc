[#answer]
B

[#explanation]

There is no such thing as a 'Sprint Zero' according to the Scrum Guide. 

There is no such thing as a 'Release Sprint,' 'Integration Sprint' or an 'Infrastructure Sprint' according to the Scrum Guide. 

These phrases on the Scrum Master Certification exam will almost always be red herrings that point to an incorrect answer.

Scrum just has Sprints. And every Sprint must create a usable and valuable Increment of work. There are no Sprints in Scrum where you 'just set things up' or 'just get the infrastructure working.'
