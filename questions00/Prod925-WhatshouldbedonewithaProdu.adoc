Incomplete PBIs not completed in a given Sprint are returned to the Product Backlog.

They are not automatically added to the next Sprint, as priorities may have changed since the prior round of Sprint Planning took place.

And if the PBI is not completed, it definitely should not be added to the Increment. The Incrememt is only for completed work that meets the DoD.

The Product Backlog is the prioritized list of features, requirements, and other work items that the development team plans to complete over the course of the project. During each Sprint, the team selects a subset of items from the Product Backlog to work on, creating a Sprint Backlog.

One of the key principles of Scrum is that the team commits to completing the work it selects for the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint. However, if any Product Backlog Items are not completed by the end of the Sprint, they are not automatically added to the next Sprint Backlog. Instead, they are returned to the Product Backlog for reprioritization and consideration for future Sprints.

There are several reasons why this is the case.

Firstly, the Sprint is a timeboxed period of typically 2-4 weeks during which the team works to complete the items selected for the Sprint Backlog. The goal of the Sprint is to deliver a potentially releasable increment of the product. If the team fails to complete all the work in the Sprint Backlog, it means that the increment is not potentially releasable, which is not in line with the principles of Scrum.

Secondly, returning unfinished work to the Product Backlog allows the team to reevaluate the priority of the items and potentially select a different set of items for the next Sprint. This helps to ensure that the team is working on the most valuable work and responding to changing business needs.

Finally, by returning unfinished work to the Product Backlog, the team can take the time to reassess and adjust their estimates and capacity for future Sprints. This helps to ensure that they are setting realistic goals and commitments for each Sprint and continuously improving their performance over time.
