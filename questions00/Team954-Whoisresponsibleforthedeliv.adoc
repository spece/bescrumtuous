The product under development is very advanced, and will likely be fairly complicated for new users. 

Part of the product backlog includes the creation of extensive user documentation, including screen-shots, how-to guides and even video demos.

D

[#explanation]

Option D is correct. 

"Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint."

A Scrum Team is responsible for the creation of an increment that meets the Definition of Done, and it is the developers who do the work. 

If Technical Documentation is a Product Backlog item, or it is included in the Definition of Done, the developers on the Scrum Team are expected to have the skills and time to create it.

"Scrum Teams are cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint."

Furthermore, there are no 'special teams' in Scrum. The Scrum Guide clearly states: "Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarchies."

In Scrum, the Development Team is responsible for creating a potentially releasable product Increment every Sprint that meets the Definition of Done. If user documentation is part of the "Done" criteria, then the Development Team must find a way to produce it.

"The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required."
