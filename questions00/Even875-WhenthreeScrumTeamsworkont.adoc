There is nothing in the Scrum Guide that requires teams working on the same project to have the same Sprint length.

When the Scrum Guide does not directly address a topic, then there are no specific rules about it.

The Scrum Guide says teams working on the same Product must have:

- The same Product Owner
- The same Product Goal
- The same Product Backlog
- The same Definition of Done

But should the teams start their Sprints on the same day? End them on the same day? Make their Sprints the same lenght?

The Scrum Guide is silent on the issue. It's up to the team to decide what is best for them.

The Scrum self-identifies as an 'incomplete framework'. It's just a guide. It doesn't have all the answers.
