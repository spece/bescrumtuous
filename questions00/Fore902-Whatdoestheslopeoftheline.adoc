D

A trend line through a release burndown chart indicates how fast work is being completed relative to the original plan, and can help visualize progress toward completion of a Release Goal.

The Scrum Guide only makes a short reference to burndown charts, and even then, it says they are not a replacement for empiricism.

You don't need to be a burndown chart expert. But knowing what one is will keep you from being caught off guard on the Scrum certification exam.
