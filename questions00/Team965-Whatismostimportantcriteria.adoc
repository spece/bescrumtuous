There are not subteams, titles or hierarchies on Scrum Teams.

All that matters when a group of Scrum developers is assembled is whether they have, or do they have the ability to acquire, the cross-functional skills matrix needed to build the product under development and achieve the Product Goal.

From the Scrum Guide: "Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarchies. It is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal. Scrum Teams are cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint. They are also self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how."
