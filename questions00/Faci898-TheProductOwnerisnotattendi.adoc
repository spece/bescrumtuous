It is the Scrum Master's job to work with team members and help them understand Scrum theory and practice.

Coaching the Product Owner on why Scrum Events are important and facilitating ways the Product Owner can get more value out of these Scrum Events is one of the Scrum Master's jobs.

The Scrum Master should also coach this Product Owner on the fact that the PO is the one who maximizes the value generated by the Scrum Team, and the primary way that happens is by ordering the Product Backlog by priority.

"The Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. They do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization."
