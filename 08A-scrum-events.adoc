== Chapter 8
=== Scrum Events

The are four events in Scrum that occur within the confines of a Sprint:

- The Sprint Planning event
- The Daily Scrum
- The Sprint Retrospective
- The Sprint Review

[quote, 2020 Scrum Guide page 7]
____
The Sprint is a container for all other events.
____

The fact that the four events mentioned above all happen within a fifth event known as the Sprint, will likely show up in five or six questions on the Scrum Master Certification exam.

=== The Sprint Container

The Scrum Guide says Sprint is a container for all other events.

That means the Sprint Review, Spring Planning, the Sprint Retrospective, and the Daily Scrum all happen within the Sprint.

- None of the Scrum events happen before the Sprint.
- None of the Scrum events happen after the Sprint
- Nothing in Scrum happens at the moment where one Sprint ends and the next Sprint begins



[quote, 2020 Scrum Guide page 7]
____
A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

All the work necessary to achieve the Product Goal, including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, happen within Sprints.
____

==== Test Yourself

****
The team wants to update their Definition of Done. When is the right time to make this change?
(Choose 1)


* [ ] Any time after the current Sprint ends so long as it happens before the next Sprint starts.
* [ ] During the current Sprint's Sprint Retrospective.
* [ ] Immediately after the current Sprint ends, and before the next Sprint begins.

****

Since nothing happens before or after a Sprint, the first three options are incorrect.

The correct answer is B. 

The Sprint Retrospective is the right time to update the team's Definition of Done.

=== The Importance of the Scrum Events

The pillars of Scrum are transparency, inspection and adaptation.

The Scrum events are like feedback loops that happen at regular intervals which allow inspection and adaptation to happen. 

For the inspection that happens and the adaptations that result to be beneficial, full transparency with regards to the teams progress, which is shown through Scrum artifacts like the Increment and the Product Backlog, is requred.

[quote, 2020 Scrum Guide page 7]
____
Each event in Scrum is a _formal_ opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts. 

These events are specifically designed to enable the transparency required. 

Failure to operate any events as prescribed results in lost opportunities to inspect and adapt.
____

Inspection and adaptation are important concepts in the Scrum Framework. The Scrum events provide scheduled opportunities for that to happen, but they are not the only time these things should happen.

Any time a Scrum Team recognizes a change that demands a response, the team should respond and adapt. If it's possible to adapt and change the plan prior to a scheduled event, the team should do so. 


==== Test Yourself

****
True or False: Only the Sprint Review provides the opportunity for the team to inspect and adapt.
****

This is false. 

All of the Scrum events provide the opportunity for the team to inspect their work and adapt their plans.

Furthermore, the Scrum Team is encouraged to inspect and adapt constantly. 

There is never a bad time to adapt your plan if it helps your team achieve the Sprint Goal or come closer to achieving the Product Goal.

=== Regularity and consistency

Scrum doesn't place restrictive controls over how development takes place, but it does request that certain patterns be followed, and it requires that those patterns happen with predictable regularity.

[quote, 2020 Scrum Guide page 7]
____
Events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum.
____

Many people complain that Scrum has too many meetings. It doesn't.

- There is one timeboxed meeting to plan what to do during the Sprint
- There's a quick, 15-minute Daily Scrum to allow developers to touch base
- There is a Sprint Review at the end of the Sprint where the stakeholders are invited
- There's a Sprint Retrospective where the team talks about what they could do better

That doesn't sound like too many meetings to me. In fact, it sounds like it's exactly the right number of meetings a team should have. 

The meetings that Scrum does have are intended to have maximum effectiveness on transparency, while at the same time eliminating the need for other meetings.

Teams that complain about Scrum having too many meetings probably aren't doing Scrum properly.

==== Test Yourself

****
The CTO wants to schedule afternoon status meetings with the dev team to monitor the progress of an important feature. What should the Scrum Master do?

* [ ] Allow the afternoon meetings to take place until the feature is complete
* [ ] Invite the CTO to participate in the Daily Scrum in place of the afternoon meetings
* [ ] Coach the CTO on how Scrum provides transparency through existing Scrum events and artifacts
* [ ] Have the Product Owner send reports from the Daily Scrum to the CTO to avoid the extra meetings

****
Option C is correct.

When stakeholders attempt to manage the Scrum Developers, it is often because they want more transparency into what is happening in terms of product development.

Scrum already provides enough meetings, in the form of events, to allow for transparent inspection of progress. Scrum artifacts like the Product Backlog and the Increment also provide transparency and openness.

If a stakeholder is concerned about transparency, a Scrum Master should coach the individual on how existing events and artifacts should provide all the transparency they need.

'''

=== Same Time, Same Place

While it's not always pragmatically possible, Scrum asks that all of the Scrum Events happen at the same time and in the same place. 

- The Daily Scrum takes place at the same time and location
- The Sprint Retrospective takes place at the same time and location
- The Sprint Review takes place at the same time and location
- Sprint Planning takes place at the same time and location

This makes the Scrum events more predictable, easier to plan around, and more likely to have full participation from everyone involved.

[quote, 2020 Scrum Guide page 7]
____
Optimally, all events are held at the same time and place to reduce complexity.
____

Of course, Scrum isn't completely unreasonable and unforgiving when it comes to a rule like this. The time and place are allowed to be adjusted for pragmatic reasons. 

I mean, if the place you typically hold the Daily Scrum is being fumigated, it's okay to move the Daily Scrum to Conference Room B. Just try to keep the time and place as unchanged as possible.

==== Test Yourself

****
The development team wants to move Friday's Daily Scrum, which normally takes place at 1pm, to 8 am so developers can leave work early for the weekend.

How do you respond as the Scrum Master?

* [ ] Respect the self-managing Scrum Team and reschedule Friday's Daily Scrum
* [ ] Change the time of the Daily Scrum to 8am for every day of the week
* [ ] Explain to the team that the Daily Scrum must always take place at the same time and location
* [ ] Ask the Product Owner if it's agreeable to changing the Daily Scrum to 8 am on Friday

****

Option C is correct.

Since the Daily Scrum is a Scrum Event, and since Scrum Events are supposed to take place at the same time and location every time they occur, the Scrum Master would need to explain to the team that it can't arbitrarily change the time the Daily Scrum takes place on Fridays.
