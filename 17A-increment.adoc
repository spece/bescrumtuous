== Chapter 17
=== The Increment

Scrum is an iterative and incremental framework.

We've seen how Scrum is iterative. Scrum just does Sprint after Sprint after Sprint. The same events repeat over and over again.

But how is Scrum incremental?

=== Iterative and Incremental

In Scrum, we add to the product every Sprint. Every Sprint is supposed to deliver an Increment that is useful and valuable.

You never do a Sprint that doesn't try to create something. 

There are no 'infrastructure Sprints' in Scrum where you just ensure everyone has the right software installed and access to the JIRA board.

In Scrum, every Sprint must create something of value that adds to the existing product in a useful and meaningful way.

That's how Scrum is incremental. Every Sprint adds to what was created in the Sprints prior. At least that's the objective.


[quote, 2020 Scrum Guide page 11]
____

An Increment is a concrete steppingstone toward the Product Goal. 

Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. 

To provide value, the Increment must be usable.

____

=== Integrated Increments

An increment must be added to what's already been done, and it must be able to fully integrate and work with all previous increments.

If an increment isn't compatible with past increments, then it's not a valid increment. If an increment stands alone and doesn't increase the value of the product built to date, then it's not a valid increment.

On the certification exam, there will be many questions about integration, which is confusing, because there is no talk in the Scrum Guide about integration.

- The is no integration of Sprints in Scrum
- There are no integration teams in Scrum
- There are events where integration happens

However, whatever you create today must be able to 'integrate with' or 'work with' whatever you created yesterday for it to be a valid increment.

=== Understanding Integration

Some questions on the Scrum Master certification exam will ask you about integration. Software developers get tripped up on the word 'integration' because they get visions of merging code or fixing Git conflicts or doing GitHub pull requests. Don't confuse yourself with those things. The idea of 'integration' is much simpler.

Imagine you're a carpenter and you built a door for the house your team is building. The door is currently tied to the roof of your car. Is it integrated?

No, a door sitting on the roof of your car that is supposed to go on the house your building is not integrated with the house if it's strapped to the roof of your car.

When the door is put on its hinges and attached to the house, it is now integrated. It becomes a useful and valuable increment. By putting the door on the house, you have integrated your work into the product, and you have added a valuable increment of work that stakeholders can see, touch, feel, and even criticize.

=== A Poorly Integrated Increment

Now imagine you took the door off the roof of your car, tried to attach it to the house and:

- The door is too large
- The hinges are incompatible
- You realize the door is the wrong color

You've done work on the door, there's no arguing about that. But has that work been integrated?

Did you just create a usable increment of work that adds to the existing project? No, you didn't, because the door is useless.

=== When to Integrate

Let's go back to the super, amazing door you created. When should you attach it to the house?

The Scrum Master exam will often ask you when you should integrate your work into the existing project. People get all flustered with these questions, wondering when the best time is to integrate your work.

So, when should you integrate your work into the existing product?

- During the Daily Scrum?
- During the Sprint Review?
- During the Sprint Retrospective?
- Right now?

Of course, 'right now' is the right answer. If you've got the perfect door ready to be put on your new house's hinges, you don't sit for two weeks waiting for the Sprint Review to do it. You integrate it right away. It would be nuts to imagine waiting two weeks to hand the front door on the house, or as we'd say in Scrum, 'integrate your work into the product.' 

As soon as your work is done you integrate your work into the product. Then you move on to the next piece of work that needs to be done.

And you keep doing that over and over and over again until it's time for the Sprint Review. All of which reinforces the next part of the Scrum Guide.


==== Test Yourself

****
Which of the following is correct?

* [ ] Scrum is incremental but not iterative
* [ ] Scrum is iterative but not incremental
* [ ] Scrum is both incremental and iterative
* [ ] Scrum is neither incremental nor iterative

****
Option C is correct.

Scrum is iterative in that a set of steps get repeated each sprint, and it is incremental in that each Sprint produces an increment of work that gets added to all past increments.

'''
=== Multiple Increments

The goal of each Sprint is to get at least one valuable and usable Increment added to the project. But that shouldn't stop you from integrating as many Increments as you can.

If a carpeted adds a front door to a house, she doesn't wait until the next Sprint to start working on the back door. She gets working on the back door and integrates that into the house as soon she's done with that. Increments should keep being added to the product constantly throughout Sprint.

[quote, 2020 Scrum Guide page 12]
____

Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint. 

The sum of the Increments is presented at the Sprint Review thus supporting empiricism. 

However, an Increment may be delivered to stakeholders before the end of the Sprint. 

The Sprint Review should never be considered a gate to releasing value.

Work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the Definition of Done.
____

=== Continuous Delivery of Valuable Increments 

Some people get the impression that the only time stakeholders should be allowed to see what developers have done is at the Sprint Review.

If the developers create an increment, they want the stakeholders to see, nothing is stopping them from presenting it to them at any time throughout the Sprint.

And why would you wait? If the developers have created something they are proud of, and the stakeholders are anxious to see it, why would the development team wait until the Sprint Review to show it to them?

The Sprint Review makes sure the stakeholders get to see progress at least one time throughout a Sprint, but that just ensures a minimum. Developers are always encouraged to be transparent and share their progress with interested stakeholders.

=== Commitment: Definition of Done

[quote, 2020 Scrum Guide page 12]
____
The Definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product.

The moment a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born.
____

The definition of done must be clear and understood by everyone on the Scrum Team and by the stakeholders and the organization. It creates a common understanding of what has to be done for a feature to be complete.

==== Test Yourself

****
True or false: The Definition of Done is an informal understanding of what needs to be done to turn a Product Backlog item into an Increment.
****

This is false.

The Definition of Done is a formal description, not an informal understanding.

'''

==== Test Yourself

****
The application has failed to scale beyond a single processing core, and this has caused various production issues. What is the best way for the Scrum Team to proceed with this issue?

* [ ] Assign multi-core processing support to the DevOps team
* [ ] Create a testing team to implement multi-processor support
* [ ] Add multi-processor support to the Definition of Done
* [ ] Inform that the QA team that they should test the app on multiple processors

****
Option C is correct.

If there is a quality metric that the product must support, it is the development team's responsibility to support it. If the requirement is added to the Definition of Done, the developers will not be allowed to release or integrate any increments that don't meet the multi-processor requirement.

Remember that there are no sub-teams in Scrum, and there is no talk anywhere about DevOps, UAT, or QA teams anywhere in the Scrum Guide.

'''
=== Scrum Pillars, Transparency, and 'Done'

[quote, 2020 Scrum Guide page 12]
____

The Definition of Done creates transparency by providing everyone with a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment. 

If a Product Backlog item does not meet the Definition of Done, it cannot be released or even presented at the Sprint Review. 

Instead, it returns to the Product Backlog for future consideration.
____

Test takers are often killed on this point, so pay attention.

When a Product Backlog item is not completed during a Sprint, it is put back into the Product Backlog.

- It's not presented at the Sprint Review
- It is not 'partially presented' at the Sprint Review
- Partial points are not assigned to it (There are no 'points' in Scrum!)
- The feature is not automatically added to the next Sprint's Sprint Backlog
- The feature is not partially released

If a Product Backlog item selected for the Sprint does not meet the Definition of Done by the end of the Sprint, it is thrown back into the Product Backlog as though nobody had ever even been working on it. Even if it's 90% complete, it's thrown back into the Product Backlog for the Product Owner to reprioritize.


****
An important, critical feature is 99% done at the time of the Sprint Review. What should the team do?

* [ ] Present the work completed for stakeholders to see at the Sprint Review
* [ ] Assign 99% of the points to the current Sprint and assign 1% of the points to the next Sprint
* [ ] Automatically add the Product Backlog item to the next Sprint's Sprint Backlog
* [ ] Extend the Sprint by an extra day to allow the developer to get the feature to 100%
* [ ] Return the item to the Product Backlog and do not present it at the Sprint Review

****

Option E is correct.

The Scrum Guide is clear. If a feature does not meet the definition of done, it is not presented at the Sprint Review, and it is returned to the Product Backlog.

'''

=== Organizational Standards


[quote, 2020 Scrum Guide page 12]
____

If the Definition of Done for an increment is part of the standards of the organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. 

If it is not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a Definition of Done appropriately for the product.
____

Who creates the Definition of Done?

It's created by the Scrum Team unless there is already an existing organizational standard.

If the Scrum Team wants to create a more rigorous Definition of Done, they are certainly allowed to do that, but under no circumstances 

=== Done Over Time

One of the interesting things that happen with Scrum Teams as they become more familiar with the framework and the product they are building is they extend and enhance their Definition of Done. Over time, the Definition will likely become more rigorous, with more quality gates to pass than when the team first adopted Scrum.

****
Who creates the Definition of Done?

* [ ] The Product Owner if there is no organizational standard
* [ ] The Scrum Master if there is no organizational standard
* [ ] The Scrum Developers if there is no organizational standard
* [ ] The stakeholders if there is no organizational standard

****

Option C is correct.

The Scrum Team creates a Definition of Done if an organizational standard does not exist.

'''

[quote, 2020 Scrum Guide page 12]
____
The Developers are required to conform to the Definition of Done. 

If multiple Scrum Teams are working together on a product, they must mutually define and comply with the same Definition of Done.
____

There are only a few instances in the Scrum Guide where it discusses multiple teams working on the same project.

The rules the Scrum Guide requires for multiple teams working on the same project are few, but you will be tested on all of them. Those rules demand that multiple Scrum Teams that work on the same project must:

- Each shares the same Product Owner
- Each shares the same Product Backlog
- Each shares the same Product Goal
- Each shares the same Definition of Done

Also, teams may invite members from other teams to their Sprint Planning meeting.


=== What Scrum Doesn't Say About Multiple Teams

There is nothing in the Scrum Guide that asserts multiple teams working on the same project must:

- Start their Sprints at the same time
- Have Sprints that are the same length
- Have the same number of team members
- Have the same Scrum Master

There will be several questions about multiple teams working on the same project on the certification exam, and those questions will provide options that seem reasonable but are incorrect.

When answering questions in the certification exam, focus on answers that map as closely as possible to what is in the Scrum Guide. Don't hunt for pragmatic answers. Hunt for correct answers.

****
What must share between multiple teams working on the same product?

* [ ] The Product Owner
* [ ] The Scrum Master
* [ ] The Sprint Backlog
* [ ] The Product Backlog

****

Options A and D are correct.

Each Scrum team has its own Sprint Backlog.

A Scrum Master can be shared between multiple teams, or a Scrum master can dedicate 100% of their time to one team. The Scrum Guide guide doesn't advise against either scenario.

When multiple teams work on the same project together:

- Each team shares the same Product Owner
- Each team shares the same Product Backlog
- Each team shares the same Product Goal
- Each team shares the same Definition of Done
